A Sh handler for mkdocstrings.

This is a project unrelated to mkdocstrings-shell project. I named it mkdocstrings-sh to cause confusion.

The features and style by mkdocstrings-shell were not in line with what I wanted. So I decided to write my own library. This is the result.

See the generated mkdocs pages in github pages for full documentation.

Most of the pages have been automatically generated by mkdocstring template. I do not use gitter.

See examples/ page in mkdocs documentation. I did it, I show there examples.


## Installation

```bash
pip install mkdocstrings-sh
```

## Usage:

With the following header file:

```
--8<-- "docs/examples/readme.sh"
```

Generate docs for this file with this instruction in one of your Markdown page:

```
::: path/to/script
```

This will generate the following HTML:

::: docs/examples/readme.sh
